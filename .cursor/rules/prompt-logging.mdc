# Prompt Logging

- After every request, append an entry to `logs/ai-prompts/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (create if missing).
- Entry format (one line): `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm UTC | USER | "<prompt>" | files: path1,path2 | tests: <tests or none>`
- Use initials or short user id for USER (ask if unknown).
- If no files were changed, use `files: none`.
- If no tests were run, use `tests: none`.
- Keep entries ASCII and concise; no multi-line blocks.
