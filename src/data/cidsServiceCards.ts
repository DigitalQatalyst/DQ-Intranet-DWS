      overview: 'This section introduces the CI.DS (Content Item Design System) as the formal replacement of the CI.PF (Content Item Production Framework), signalling a shift from a static set of production rules to a dynamic, modular, and quality-driven content system. The CI.DS is designed to embed greater intentionality, traceability, and performance assurance into the way content is envisioned, created, reviewed, and delivered across all DQ platforms.\n\nBy anchoring the CI.DS within DQ\'s wider ecosystem—including DTMB (Books), DTMI (Insights), DTMP (Platform), TMaaS (Deliverables), and DTMA (Academy)—this introduction highlights how content is no longer a support function, but a strategic driver of thought leadership, brand credibility, and organizational learning. It sets the tone for the system\'s multi-staged structure and positions it as an operational backbone for delivering impactful, mission-aligned content consistently and at scale.',

CI.DS changes this experience. It provides a shared, end-to-end system that brings order to the entire content lifecycle—from intent and planning to creation, review, and publication. By introducing common standards, roles, and checkpoints, CI.DS removes ambiguity, reduces rework, and makes quality repeatable rather than accidental. As a result, teams spend less time correcting and coordinating, and more time creating content that is clear, credible, and impactful—allowing content to function as a strategic asset that consistently advances DQ\'s thought leadership, brand trust, and learning mission at scale.'

The canvas helps define where content will be published, how it will be positioned, and the expected outcomes from its publication.\n\n**Key Elements of the Dissemination Canvas:**\n\n- **Content Format:** What type of content is being published (e.g., blog post, whitepaper, case study)?\n- **Target Audience:** Who is the intended audience, and how should the content be positioned to engage them?\n- **Publishing Channels:** Where will the content be distributed (e.g., website, social media, email, external publications)?\n- **Promotion Strategy:** How will the content be amplified? Will it be promoted via social media, partnerships, email campaigns, etc.?\n- **Performance Metrics:** How will success be measured? Define metrics like views, shares, comments, and conversions.\n\nThe Dissemination Canvas ensures a clear, strategic approach to how content is launched across various channels and helps avoid haphazard publishing.'
