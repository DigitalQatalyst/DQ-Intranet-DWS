                  The Associate Owned Asset Initiative is a strategic effort aimed at enhancing operational efficiency, reducing asset management costs, and improving the accountability of devices used for company work. As a result of this initiative, the Associate Owned Asset Guidelines have been developed to mitigate the risk of asset theft by departing associates, while ensuring secure management and compliance with company standards. Through flexible options such as BYOD, FYOD and HYOD, DQ empowers associates to manage their own devices, fostering a more efficient and scalable approach to device management.
