# ⚠️ IMAGES NEED TO BE ADDED

The glossary page is ready, but the image files are missing.

## To Fix "Image not showing":

**You need to add these 2 PNG files:**

1. Copy your `6xd.png` file to:
   ```
   public/images/knowledge/6xd.png
   ```

2. Copy your `ghc.png` file to:
   ```
   public/images/knowledge/ghc.png
   ```

## Quick Steps:

1. **Find your image files** (the D6 diagram and Golden Honeycomb diagram)
2. **Copy them** to the `public/images/knowledge/` folder
3. **Refresh your browser**

## Verify:

After adding, run:
```bash
ls -la public/images/knowledge/
```

You should see:
- `6xd.png`
- `ghc.png`

The code is already set up correctly - it just needs the actual image files!
